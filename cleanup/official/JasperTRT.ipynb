        "## 1. Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The Jasper model is an end-to-end neural acoustic model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) that provides near state-of-the-art results on LibriSpeech among end-to-end ASR models without any external data. The Jasper architecture of convolutional layers was designed to facilitate fast GPU inference, by allowing whole sub-blocks to be fused into a single GPU kernel. This is important for meeting strict real-time requirements of ASR systems in deployment.The results of the acoustic model are combined with the results of external language models to get the top-ranked word sequences corresponding to a given audio segment. This post-processing step is called decoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original paper is Jasper: An End-to-End Convolutional Neural Acoustic Model https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03288.pdf.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1 Model architecture\n",
        "By default the model configuration is Jasper 10x5 with dense residuals. A Jasper BxR model has B blocks, each consisting of R repeating sub-blocks.\n",
        "Each sub-block applies the following operations in sequence: 1D-Convolution, Batch Normalization, ReLU activation, and Dropout. \n",
        "In the original paper Jasper is trained with masked convolutions, which masks out the padded part of an input sequence in a batch before the 1D-Convolution.\n",
        "For inference masking is not used. The reason for this is that in inference, the original mask operation does not achieve better accuracy than without the mask operation on the test and development dataset. However, no masking achieves better inference performance especially after TensorRT optimization.\n",
        "More information on the model architecture can be found in the [root folder](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/SpeechRecognition/Jasper)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 TensorRT Inference pipeline\n",
        "The Jasper inference pipeline consists of 3 components: data preprocessor, acoustic model and greedy decoder. The acoustic model is the most compute intensive, taking more than 90% of the entire end-to-end pipeline. The acoustic model is the only component with learnable parameters and also what differentiates Jasper from the competition. So, we focus on the acoustic model for the most part.\n",
        "For the non-TRT Jasper inference pipeline, all 3 components are implemented and run with native PyTorch. For the TensorRT inference pipeline, we show the speedup of running the acoustic model with TensorRT, while preprocessing and decoding are reused from the native PyTorch pipeline.\n",
        "To run a model with TensorRT, we first construct the model in PyTorch, which is then exported into an ONNX file. Finally, a TensorRT engine is constructed from the ONNX file, serialized to TRT plan file, and also launched to do inference.\n",
        "Note that TensorRT engine is being runtime optimized before serialization. TRT tries a vast set of options to find the strategy that performs best on user’s GPU - so it takes a few minutes. After the TRT plan file is created, it can be reused."
