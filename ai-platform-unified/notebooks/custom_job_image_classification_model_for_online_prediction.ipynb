    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this tutorial is the [cifar10 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10) from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview). The version of the dataset you will use is built into Tensorflow. The trained model predicts which type of class an image is from ten classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.\n",

    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to create a custom model from a Python script in a docker container using the AI Platform (Unified) SDK, and then do a prediction on the deployed model. You can alternatively create custom models from the command line using `gcloud` or online using Google Cloud Console.\n",

    "- Create an AI Platform (Unified) custom job for training a model.\n",
    "- Train the model.\n",
    "- Retrieve and load the model (artifacts).\n",
    "- View the model evaluation.\n",

    "Now that you have seen the basic steps for custom training, you will do a new custom job to train a model. There are two ways you can train a custom model using a container image:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use a Google Cloud prebuilt container**. If you use a prebuilt container, you will additionally specify a Python package to install into the container image. This Python package contains your code for training a custom model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use your own custom container image**. If you use your own container, the container needs to contain your code for training a custom model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will train a CIFAR10 model using a Google Cloud prebuilt container. You need to update the worker pool specification by adding a description for `python_package_spec`. This section will tell the custom job the Python training package to install and which Python module to invoke, along with command line arguments for the Python module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive deeper now into the python package specification:\n",

    "-`executor_image_spec`: This is the docker image which is configured for your custom training job. You will continue to use the same one we used earlier for demonstration.\n",

    "-`package_uris`: This is a list of the locations (URIs) of your python training packages to install on the provisioned instance. The locations need to be in a Cloud Storage bucket. These can be either individual python files or a zip (archive) of an entire package. In the later case, the job service will unzip (unarchive) the contents into the docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "-`python_module`: The python module (script) to invoke for running the custom training job. In this example, you will be invoking `trainer.task.py` -- note that it was not neccessary to append the `.py` suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "-`args`: The command line arguments to pass to the corresponding pythom module. In this example, you will be:\n",
    "  - `\"--model-dir=\" + MODEL_DIR` : The Cloud Storage location where to store the model artifacts. There are two ways to tell the training script where to save the model artifacts:\n",
    "      - direct: You pass the Cloud Storage location as a command line argument to your training script (set variable `DIRECT = True`), or\n",
    "      - indirect: The service passes the Cloud Storage location as the environment variable `AIP_MODEL_DIR` to your training script (set variable `DIRECT = False`). In this case, you tell the service the model artifact location in the job specification.\n",
    "  - `\"--epochs=\" + EPOCHS`: The number of epochs for training.\n",
    "  - `\"--steps=\" + STEPS`: The number of steps (batches) per epoch.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, you will upload your TF.Keras model from the custom job to AI Platform (Unified) model service, which will create a AI Platform (Unified) model resource for your custom model. During upload, you need to define a serving function to convert data to the format your model expects. If you send encoded data to AI Platform, your serving function ensures that the data is decoded on the model server before it is passed as input to your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the serving function work\n",
    "\n",
    "When you send a request to an online prediction server, the request is received by a HTTP server. The HTTP server\n",
    "extracts the prediction request from the HTTP request content body. The extracted prediction request is forwarded to the serving function. For Google pre-built prediction containers, the request content is passed to the serving function as a `tf.string`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The serving function consists of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `preprocessing function`:  \n",
    "  - Converts the input (`tf.string`) to the input shape and data type of the underlying model (dynamic graph).\n",
    "  - Performs the same preprocessing of the data that was done during training the underlying model -- e.g., normalizing, scaling, etc.\n",
    "- `post-processing function`:  \n",
    "  - Converts the model output to format expected by the receiving application -- e.q., compresses the output.\n",
    "  - Packages the output for the the receiving application -- e.g., add headings, make JSON object, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Both the preprocessing and post-processing functions are converted to static graphs which are fused to the model. The output from the underlying model is passed to the post-processing function. The post-processing function passes the converted/packaged output back to the HTTP server. The HTTP server returns the output as the HTTP response content.\n",
    "\n",
    "One consideration you need to consider when building serving functions for TF.Keras models is that they run as static graphs. That means, you cannot use TF graph operations that require a dynamic graph. If you do, you will get an error during the compile of the serving function which will indicate that you are using an EagerTensor which is not supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serving function for image data\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass images to the prediction service, you encode the compressed (e.g., JPEG) image bytes into base 64 -- which makes the content safe from modification while transmitting binary data over the network. Since this deployed model expects input data as raw (uncompressed) bytes, you need to ensure that the base 64 encoded data gets converted back to raw bytes before it is passed as input to the deployed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, define a serving function (`serving_fn`) and attach it to the model as a preprocessing step. Add a `@tf.function` decorator so the serving function is fused to the underlying model (instead of upstream on a CPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you send a prediction or explanation request, the content of the request is base 64 decoded into a Tensorflow string (`tf.string`), which is passed to the serving function (`serving_fn`). The serving function preprocesses the `tf.string` into raw (uncompressed) numpy bytes (`preprocess_fn`) to match the input requirements of the model:\n",
    "- `io.decode_jpeg`- Decompresses the JPG image which is returned as a Tensorflow tensor with three channels (RGB).\n",
    "- `image.convert_image_dtype` - Changes integer pixel values to float 32.\n",
    "- `image.resize` - Resizes the image to match the input shape for the model.\n",
    "- `resized / 255.0` - Rescales (normalization) the pixel data between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the data can be passed to the model (`m_call`)."
