    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to optimize large distributed training jobs with the Vertex Training Reduction Server. The [TensorFlow NLP Modelling Toolkit](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp#tensorflow-nlp-modelling-toolkit) from the [TensorFlow Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) is used to preprocess the data and create the model and training loop. `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` from the `tf.distribute` module is used to distribute model training across multiple machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this tutorial is the [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MNLI)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/glue#gluemnli) from the GLUE benchmark. This dataset is loaded from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), and used to fine tune a BERT model for sentence prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you create a custom-trained model from a Python script in a Docker container. You learn how to configure, submit, and monitor a Vertex Training job that uses Reduction Server to optimize network bandwith and latency of the gradient reduction operation in distributed training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert the MNLI dataset to the format required by the TensorFlow NLP Modelling Toolkit.\n",
    "- Create a Vertex AI custom job that uses Reduction Server.\n",
    "- Submit and monitor the job.\n",

To avoid conflicts when multiple workers write to the same storage location, the driver code has been modified so that each worker uses a different storage location based on its role in a Vertex compute cluster.
