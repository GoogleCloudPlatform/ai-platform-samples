    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the AI Platform (Unified) Python SDK to create image models and do batch prediction using Google Cloud's [AutoML Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this tutorial is the Salads category of the [OpenImages dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/open_images_v4) from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview). This dataset does not require any feature engineering. The version of the dataset you will use in this tutorial is stored in a public Cloud Storage bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to create an object detection model with AutoML Vision from a Python script, and then do a batch prediction using the AI Platform (Unified) SDK. You can alternatively create models with AutoML Vision from the command line using `gcloud` or online using Google Cloud Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a AI Platform (Unified) managed Dataset.\n",
    "- Train the model for up to one hour.\n",
    "- View the model evaluation.\n",
    "- Make a batch prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is the batch prediction service different than using the prediction service of a deployed model with multiple instances. There is one key difference, but otherwise they are essentially the same as far as outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prediction Service - Does an on-demand prediction for the entire set of instances (i.e., one or more data items) and returns the results in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Batch Prediction Service - Does a queued (batch) prediction for the entire set of instances in the background and stores the results in a Cloud Storage bucket when ready.\n",
