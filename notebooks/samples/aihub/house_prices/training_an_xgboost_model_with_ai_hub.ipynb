    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Hub is a repository of plug-and-play AI components including end-to-end AI pipelines and out-of-the-box algorithms. The following is an example of using the [XGBoost AI Hub container](https://aihub.cloud.google.com/u/0/p/products%2F0ccd8a63-71a7-4e48-a68b-685692a62e92) to train a model with the AI Platform Training service and creating a model endpoint using AI Platform Prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Hub includes components that make it easy to run training jobs at scale on Google's cloud infrastructure. Without revising any code, users can run distributed training jobs on a variety of hardware (including GPU and TPU devices). These components offer native support for AI Platform Training and export trained model files that can be uploaded to AI Platform Prediction for generating inferences. The components also include a run report that provides practical insights into the behavior of the trained model, and a visual inspection of the training and validation error for each run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this notebook includes residential real-estate data for homes in Ames, Iowa. The data are stored in a tabular format (.CSV) and include the sale price of 1,460 homes along with 79 explanatory features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comes from Kaggle's [competition to predict House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The Kaggle API can be used to download and import the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook provides an example workflow of using an AI Hub component to train an XGBoost regression model and create an endpoint for generating predictions.\n",
    "\n",
